  <br><h2>Taking Photos</h2>
  <p>Ever since camera opscura was invented, so-called Decisive Moment is every photographer's desperate goal.
  <br>Thanks to the modern technology, everyone has their own shot in hands.
  <br>We have yet to see but still a relatively bigger body with broader lense does its part.
  <br>With a ten-year-old camera, Sony A7, my decisive moments come back alive anytime I want.</p>
