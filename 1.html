  <br><h2>Playing Guitar</h2>
  <p>You may compose your own masterpiece or just simply copy a famous pop music song.
  <br>Pick up your guitar from the deck and start strumming.
  <br>It stays there for ages waiting for your prodoge skill.
  <br>Hold your breath and brace yourself for the next moment.
  <br>What you plays defines what you feel.
